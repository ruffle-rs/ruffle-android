            Welcome screen is new feature and in future will be added here more options. It should appear only once per installation or when it is forced by new update.
            PLEASE report if welcome screen appears AGAIN and AGAIN even you went though all welcome screen pages and submitted at the end. If it happens, then is bug in android system
            and it must be done else. Many thanks
