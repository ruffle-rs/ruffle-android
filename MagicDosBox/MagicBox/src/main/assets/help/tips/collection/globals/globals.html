            Android has inconsistent access to directories and folders. It's very hard to detect external devices such as SD-Cards. Android provides some functions
            for detecting these, but they fail for many devices. Magic DOSBox uses an improved detection algorithm, but it is not quite at 100%. If you experience that
            Magic DOSBox can't locate your SD-Card then you can add the path manually. It's fairly intuitive. Another advantage of this option is that you can
            make shortcuts to various directories like "Downloads".

            <b><font color='#C6CDA8'>Control user interface with gamepad</font></b>
        </div>
        <div>
            Since v42 is Magic Dosbox's interface fully controllable with gamepad. This feature is available from Android 5 (API level 21). Navigation over user interface is handled
            with special on-screen cursor. This cursor is enabled by default only on devices with Android TV operating systems, but standard Android system can enable it
            as well.<br/><br/>
        </div>
        <div>
            Use left analog stick for controlling the cursor. L1 and R1 scroll interface up and down. Buttons X and A emulates tap. Button B sends "Back" button.
        </div>
        <div>
            <b><font color='#ffa500'>Reserved Button</font></b> - While main menu does not require this special button, when we play game we need one button to have
            reserved for activating user interface. This button is important, because we can bind buttons X,A,L1,R1,B to specific game actions, but we need them for
            controlling Magic Dosbox's interface too. Special cursor is hidden when game starts. Press "Reserved button" to get it on screen.

            <b><font color='#C6CDA8'>Size</font></b>
        </div>
        <div>
            In this section is possible override default size for filebrowser, various menu dialogs and image viewer. Default size tries calculate best size for your device.

            <b><font color='#C6CDA8'>Language</font></b>

            You can change the GUI language to a supported language. Please note that this project is the result of our enthusiasm and is made in our free time.
            Language packs are made by our fans and we send them our big thanks. If you to want help with additional translation then you can
            export the current language packs to the MagicBox folder and edit it. You can then check your work with the "Test" button.
