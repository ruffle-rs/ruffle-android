            Version 33 introduced user interface for Gravis UltraSound. This UI was added because
            some games won't start with Sound Blaster, but with GUS works well. GUS requires special
            external files what must be placed into diretory ULTRASND411 (by default). And this directory
            must be placed in directory what is mounted to Drive C:\

            Path /storage/emulated/0/Games is mounted to Drive C:\. Then the directory ULTRASND411 must be placed
            here /storage/emulated/0/Games/ULTRASND411.
