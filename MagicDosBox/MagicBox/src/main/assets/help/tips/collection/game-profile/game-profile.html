            <img src="add48.png">A game profile is a set of rules which specify how and what the Magic DOSBox emulator should run. These rules define
            which computer processor needs to be emulated, what sound card should be used, whether a CD is used with the game, etc. Most of these values are set by default for you by Magic DOSBox, and are suitable for most games. You can of course get your hands dirty if so desired!

            &#8226;Using the GUI (user interface)<br/>
            &#8226;Using the expert settings (AKA manually modifying the DOSBox config file)<br/>

            Starting games using the GUI is suitable for most games. Not all of the settings are present in the GUI however. This was a design decision. I wanted the GUI to contain the basic configurations needed to run most games, but at the same time be simple enough for people who've never used a DOSBox emulator. For more experienced users, there is the "Expert Settings" option. If you want to go the advanced route, and want a template config file to work with, look in your game profile, under the "Main Program" section. To the right there is a "Get" button. You can generate an auto exec script or a full dosbox config file for your game, and copy it to your clipboard. Similar functionality can be found via the "Setup" button under the "Software"
            section.

        <div>The GUI is divided into these <a href="help/tips/collection/game-profile/sections.html" >sections</a></div>
