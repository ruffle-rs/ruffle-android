        <div>Hello, hope you are all rested after Christmas:) We rested too, but not full time. We worked on
            new update which will make happy a lot of people. First I want to thank all people who worked on
            this version. I don’t know where should I begin. I want send my thanks to Laura for core implementation
            of xbox 360 joystick and similar devices. Making GUI was then easier part. Then Jiovial and all people
            who supported french translation on french.translation@outlook.com. Magic dosbox has many texts and I
            know that translation was really hard task. Of course Alex, Richard, Benny and many others for testing
            and good ideas.</div>
