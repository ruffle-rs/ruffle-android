        <div>Hi:) New version is here;) Let me first send my thanks to Jiovial for great french update
            and to Black Mage for fantastic russian translation :) ! I believe you will be surprised how well
            they translated everything. Thanks guys!</div>
        <div>
            &#8226;Added Russian translation<br/>
            &#8226;Added possibility to hide/show all widgets. This options can be found in two places. First is
            ‘Special widget’  — and if something goes wrong then, you can  fix it in general settings
            (thank you Alex for hint)<br/>
            &#8226;Second and last part of update for design mode :  Added possibility to duplicate widget and multi-edit.<br/>
            &#8226;You can now set custom size for various menus. This options is available in Global settings.
            Fixed menu scaling in landscape mode.<br/>
            &#8226;Redesigned combo actions. Editing will work a bit differently for key, bag and ghostly presence actions.
            It is possible to set ctrl, alt and shift for key action<br/>
            &#8226;<font color="#FF0000">dim navigation bar. This is required to use with newer Android versions.  The SDK causes the
            soft menu button to no longer be available.  Google REMOVED it in API 14. So, if you remap the back button
            then use a long press on back button to call up general settings. Also you can call general settings from
            special widget</font>><br/>
            &#8226;widget ‘Mouse Touch’ and left/right mouse in Mapper has new options – double click (thanks to Black Mage for hint)<br/>
            &#8226;mouse rate in mapper was increased to 120 (thank you infernoxzx)<br/>
            &#8226;various improvements and bug fixes<br/>
