        <h4><font color='#EBB16C'>Icons too big?</font></h4>
        <div>
            Magic DOSBox sets the default size for menu icons and file manager items to medium. This size works fine for most devices.
            If you think that this size is too small or too big, you can change it in "Global Settings".
        </div>
        <div><font color='#EBB16C'>These sizes can be changed :</font></div>
        <div><font color='#C6CDA8'>1. Collection items </font></div>
        <div>
            Collection game icons. These can be changed under the section "Game collection".
        </div>
        <div><font color='#C6CDA8'>2. File browser items </font></div>
        <div>
            File manager files and folders. These can be changed under the section "Filebrowser".
        </div>
        <div><font color='#C6CDA8'>3. Various menus and image viewer</font></div>
        <div>
            The size of menus like "General Settings" can be modified, as well as when you skin a widget with predefined images. These can be changed under the section "Menu and Image Viewer".
