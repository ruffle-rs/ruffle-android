   <h4><font color='#EBB16C'>Adding an installed game with CD support</font></h4>
   <div>
       As we mentioned before, it's common and good practice to install a game first on your PC before transfering the installed game folder to your device.
       During the installation process you can chose not to install the whole game, but only the minimum. This means that the game will load the additional data
       from the CD.
   </div>
   <div><font color='#C6CDA8'>How to start?</font></div>
   <div>This tutorial is an extended version of the <a href="help/tips/collection/add-game/lesson1.html" >previous one</a>. You can follow its steps to add an installed game.
        After the game is added to the collection we can set up the CD-ROM.
   </div>
   <div><font color='#C6CDA8'>CD-ROM Setup</font></div>
   <div>Using a long-press on the added game will bring up the configuration window. Several games require one or more CDs inserted in the CD-ROM drive during play time. A CD can be added in the section
        "Hardware->CD-ROM".
   </div>
   <div><font color='#C6CDA8'>How to add a CD</font></div>
   <div>
        Enable CD-ROM support with the left checkbox. Pressing the "+" button on the right side will display the configuration window for adding a CD.
   </div>
   <div><font color='#C6CDA8'>CD Setup</font></div>
   <div>In the CD configuration window we need to set the CD label. For many games this not important. But there are some games which require an exact CD label, or else the CD will be not recognized.</div>
   <div>On a desktop PC we can simply insert a physical CD into CD-ROM drive, but this is obviously not possible on a tablet or phone. Fortunately, a CD can be dumped to a disk image that DOSBox can access. 
       Instead of the physical CD, we tell DOSBox the location of this file. Supported formats are .iso, .gog, .cue, .bin, and .inst. You can copy this file wherever you want on your device.
   </div>
   <div>If you don't have an ISO file, then you can copy the content of the CD into a folder of your choice. In the CD configuration GUI select "Map" from the folder instead Image.</div>
   <div>Confirming the setup will add the new CD to the CD collection. Don't forget to enable it!</div>
   <div>Confirm the profile changes and start the game.</div>
