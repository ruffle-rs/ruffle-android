        <div>This version introduce export/import game profile. It is first attempt to make mechanism
            for sharing game profiles between players. Importing from device with  other aspect ratio is not
            optimal, but we must start somehow.</div>

            &#8226;various bug fixes and improvements<br/>
        </div>
        <div>Long press on game profile brings profile settings. Until now you could notice “delete” button
            on right bottom side of window. This button is obsolete now, instead it calls new options. Here you can
            export, delete and duplicate your profile.
        </div>
        <div>Key widget can serve single tap – standard keyboard behavior and double tap which is useful when you
            don’t need quick reactions. Double tap worked, but this version improved reaction time and in
            addition you can set timer for custom use.
        </div>
        <div>Master of puppets widget is more customizable. You can set opacity and custom middle crosshair.</div>
        <div>There were some additional bugfixes and improvements. One of them fixed opacity crash on android 2.3.</div>
        <div>Thank you Alex for testing and good ideas.</div>
