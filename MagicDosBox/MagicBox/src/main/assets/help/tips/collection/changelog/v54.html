            &#8226;Added support for layers! Until now, all widgets were placed only on one layer, but now is possible to create multiple layers and place widget there.
            Each layer has own settings. This is significant improvement for game layout designing. We can configure layer's startup visibility in it's own options. In runtime, we can
            control it's visibility with Combo/Deadly strike action. Due layers support was rewritten a lot of core, please report bugs, best via email. Many thanks<br/><br/>
            &#8226;<font color='#DBC89F'>added slider for controlling widget's size. Resizing widgets will be now much easier</font><br/><br/>
            &#8226;Rewritten handling of widget's backgrounds. Both (colored and textured) will eat now significant less GPU memory at cost of a bit more work. This step was necessary,
            because of possible big GPU footprint due multi-layers support.<br/><br/>
            &#8226;<font color='#DBC89F'>Reduced minimum size for streaming selection in zooming widget</font><br/><br/>
            &#8226;added absolute mouse fix for Syndicate game. Because Magic Dosbox has none database for recognizing game, is necessary to enable this fix manually in game advanced settings.
            Fix has code SYND<br/><br/>
            &#8226;<font color='#DBC89F'>Mapper now supports special reserved key. This key can temporarily block/enable mapper configuration. It is useful for f.e. keyboards which don't have
            keys like F1, F2 etc. We can bind these keys to other keys and then enable/block them with reserved key. When blocked, we use original key functionality. See <a href="help/tips/ingame/general-settings/voodoo.html">FAQ</a></font><br/><br/>
            &#8226;fixed crash in zoom widget introduced in previous version (thanks for report)<br/><br/>
