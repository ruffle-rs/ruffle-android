        <div>
            Magic Dosbox stores settings in special folder "MagicBox". This folder is created during first startup in first write-able storage - mostly in internal storage.
            In this folder are stored all games settings and their layouts. There were accidents when this folder was removed with system cleaners or during uninstallation by system
            and all settings were lost.

            Backup creates full backup of your settings. Resulted file is in zip format and is possible save it to local storage. At the end of zip process you are prompted with file
            sharing picker and can be uploaded with file sharing services to web. Saving game layout with "Save" button starts counter and after several days notifies you
            for doing backup.

        <div><font color='#C6CDA8'>Restore</font></div>
        <div>
            Currently there is no functionality for backup restore. It's because backup contains core files which can't be replaced when application runs. Correct functionality will be
            provided in the future. Now please quit magic dosbox and replace old MagicBox folder with content of zip file. From version 37 Magic Dosbox supports changing data directory.
            This means, it's possible restore zipped backup to other location and switch to this directory.
