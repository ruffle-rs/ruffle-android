        <h4><font color='#EBB16C'>IPX emulation</font></h4>
        <div>
            IPX emulates classic network situation when one computer works like a server and others are clients and connect to the first one.
        </div>
        <div>
            User interface allows you to enable or completely disable IPX support.
        </div>
        <div>
            There is another useful option <font color='#C6CDA8'>"Configure at startup"</font>.
            Enabling this option forces dosbox to ask for settings confirmation at every startup.
        </div>
        <div>
            <b><font color='#C6CDA8'>Server</font></b>
        </div>
        <div>
            In the user interface you have to set your device like a server and fill the udp port. Then you need tell
            others your IP address (it's in server title or in game Advanced Settings). To obtain your IP address you must be
            connected to network.
            <div>
                You can set server manually in expert settings with this line :<br/><br/>
                ipxnet startserver [UDP port]<br/>
                For example : ipxnet startserver 2000<br/>
            </div>
        <div>
            <b><font color='#C6CDA8'>Client</font></b>
        </div>
        <div>
            Clients can connect after the server is turned on. Obtain IP address from server device and fill it in configuration.
            <div>
                This can be done manually with this line :<br/><br/>
                ipxnet connect IP Port<br/>
                For example : ipxnet connect 192.168.0.1 2000<br/>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div>
            Of course you need to do additional stuff in the game itself. You need configure whether you are server or client.
        </div>
