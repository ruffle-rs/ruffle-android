            It's been more than twenty years since applications were actively developed for MS-DOS. Currently many of these games are distributed
            for free on various websites dedicated to old or abandoned MS-DOS games. And for the games that are not free, many  still have free demo versions available.

            Unfortunately due to restrictions we are not able to post a list of supported games or where you can buy them. But I trust that if you are reading this, you likely know where to look. 
            During the MS-DOS and Win9x era, most of the game genres we know today were either created or solidified from earlier systems. You can play adventures, real-time strategies, racing games,
            role playing games, action games, dungeon crawlers, arcade and many other types of games. Try searching the web for "dosbox games" or "MS-DOS games" for more examples.
