   <h4><font color='#EBB16C'>Copying a game to your device</font></h4>
   <div>
       There are multiple ways you can get a game on your device. I won't go over them here. Google is your friend. Here are some hints: you can connect your device to a PC via cable,
       you can copy a game to your device using wi-fi, or you can just download a game from a web server. I'm going to focus on where the game data should be placed on your device.
   </div>
   <div><font color='#C6CDA8'>Where to place game data?</font></div>
   <div>
       MS-DOS and Windows set one hard-disk (HDD) as primary. For many users, this is the famous 'C:\' Drive. On this drive you can find folders like "Windows",
       "Program Files" etc. This drive is very important and we need to tell DOSBox where it's located on Android.
   </div>
   <div><font color='#C6CDA8'>Where's the C:\ Drive?</font></div>
   <div>
       The C:\ Drive is located whenever you want it -- you can specify the location within DOSBox. For example, it can be the root directory of your device
   </div>
   <div>
       For example : /storage/emulated/0/<br/>
       <font color='#7fb4dc'>NOTE : this folder varies per device!</font>
   </div>
   <div>
       We will copy the game data to this folder
   </div>
   <div><font color='#C6CDA8'>Recommended path</font></div>
   <div>
       Despite the example shown above, it is strongly recommended to not copy games to the root directory of your device. Instead, create a custom folder.
   </div>
   <div>For example : Drive_C</div>
   <div>Path will be for example : /storage/emulated/0/Drive_C</div>
