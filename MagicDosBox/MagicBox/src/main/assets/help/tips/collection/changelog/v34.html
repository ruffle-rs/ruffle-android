            &#8226;Another midi emulation - <a href="help/tips/collection/game-profile/midi.html" >Synth</a> :<br/>
            <div>
                This emulation supports Sound Fonts (*.sf2). Tested fonts are GeneralUserGSFluidSynthv1.44.sf2 (very good),
                8mbgm-emu_MT32.sf2, SGM-V2.01 (too big for old devices), Arachno_v1.0.sf2, …
            </div>
            &#8226;Because present devices are fast, the top for sound quality in user interface was increased from 44.1KHz to 48KHz<br/>
