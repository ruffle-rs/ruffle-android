            &#8226;improved storage detection<br/>
            &#8226;in Global settings (top button on left side when you start magicbox) was added new options to
            define two custom storage paths. It is useful when magicbox fails to detect external storage. You can tell
            magicbox its location manually. Additional benefit of this options is, that you can define shortcut f.e to
            downloads folder.<br/>
