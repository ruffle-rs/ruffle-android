            Android applications runs on thousands of android devices which are very different and vary per manufacturer.
            It's real challenge to make these applications working on majority of devices without any issue. These issues can be
            developer's mistakes or are caused by manufacturer himself. Fortunately, in most cases developer is able to add
            a workaround for the specific device. In addition there can be problems with different android system versions. Each
            android version is known for specific problems.

        </div>
        <div>
            &#8226;Send us email<br/>
            &#8226;Send crash report using android report system<br/>
        </div>
        <div>
            <font color='#EBB16C'>Send us email</font>
        </div>
        <div>
            Write us simple email. This is the best way, because we can ask additional information. It's VERY good if the
            bug can be reproduced.

        <div>
            <font color='#EBB16C'>Send crash report using android report system</font>
        </div>
        <div>
            If the application crashes then android provides the "Crash message" with the "Send report" possibility. This report is
            very good and contains detailed crash info. You can send report with custom message. But it's recommended to write us email
            too, because this report is one-directional and we are not able contact you back.
