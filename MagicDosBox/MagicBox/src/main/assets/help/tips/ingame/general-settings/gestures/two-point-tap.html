        <h4><font color='#EBB16C'>Two Point Tap</font></h4>
        <div>
            This is performed by quickly pressing with two fingers in succession. The first finger touches the screen and marks the mouse position for the click. Tapping with the second finger
            triggers the click.
        </div>
        <div>
            The "Two Point Tap" triggers a mouse event quickly and has a single special flag.
        </div>
        <div>
            <b><font color='#C6CDA8'>Keep mouse button down</font></b>
        </div>
        <div>
            The click triggered with the second finger performs only a mouse down-click and the first finger is able for example to select units in real-time strategy.
        </div>
        <div>
            If this flag is disabled then the mouse up-click is triggered when you pull the first finger away.
