            If you are new to Magic DOSBox, then you probably started emulation with the automatic performance settings (this is default settings from the profile
            configuration window). Automatic performance is suitable for most games, but it can run some games too fast. In this case, you
            need to switch from automatic performance to custom cycles.

            Emulation means (in very simple terms) executing cycles over time. More cycles means that a program or game will run faster. You can tune cycles
            based on your device. Setting cycles too high will lead to sound problems, but the game may run faster. Magic DOSBox starts with 3000 cycles.

            <img src="cycles48.png">If custom cycles are enabled then you can tune performance with "Power" options from the "General Settings" menu. This option is only available when "Custom Cycles" is enabled.
