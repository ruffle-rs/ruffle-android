            Holding your finger on the same place on the screen for longer than a second will emulate clicking and holding the left mouse button -- otherwise known as the "Long-Press". You may notice your finger jumps on the screen by a few pixels, and is not on the same place during timeout - this is due to the software heartbeat. Tolerance is 50px for absolute mouse and 5px for relative.
