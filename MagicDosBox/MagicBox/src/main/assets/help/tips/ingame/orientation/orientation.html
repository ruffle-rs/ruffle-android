            It's reasonable to lock display orientation to landscape, since all MS-DOS and windows games are landscape-orientated by nature. If your screen is large enough however, you may want to experiment with portrait mode for some games, since you can place a virtual d-pad or keys under the screen for example. 
            Display can be locked in "Advanced settings".
