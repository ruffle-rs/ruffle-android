            <img src="voodoo48.png">Since v.20, Magic DOSBox supports external controllers. It's possible to use various controllers like an xbox 360
            or Nvidia Wireless controller. Their buttons can be mapped to DOSBox keys, mouse buttons, native gamepad buttons or special actions.
        </div>
        <div>
            Since v47 Magic Dosbox supports two players. To get it work, enable "Two players" option and setup players. Please press "Assign players" from General Settings
            for assigning gamepads to player profile. Two players support is disabled by default. Some games detect gamepads at startup. In this case, save settings and restart
            application.

        </div>
        <div>In this section is possible setup various joystick controls like :</div>
        <div>
            &#8226;Buttons<br/>
            &#8226;Dpad<br/>
            &#8226;Left joystick<br/>
            &#8226;Right joystick<br/>
            &#8226;L2 and R2 axis<br/>
        </div>

            <font color='#C6CDA8'>Buttons</font>
        </div>
        <div>
            Classic buttons what works like a keyboard keys. They have an Up and Down state and can be bound to these actions:
            <div>
                &#8226;Keys<br/>
                &#8226;Left and Right mouse click<br/>
                &#8226;Native gamepad buttons<br/>
                &#8226;Show keyboard<br/>
                &#8226;Widgets - currently only deadly strike (macro) is supported<br/>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div>
            <font color='#C6CDA8'>Dpad</font>
        </div>
        <div>
            Dpad can be controlled with
            <div>
                &#8226;KeyPad - standard keyboard keys<br/>
                &#8226;2Axis - support for native 2axis joystick. Dpad does not support fully functional 2axis range, but only edges -1,0,1. This is very useful for game calibration or for old DOS games
                what don't need full axis range.<br/>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div>
            <font color='#C6CDA8'>Left and Right joystick</font>
        </div>
        <div>
            Left and right joysticks support these controls :
            <div>
                &#8226;KeyPad - standard keyboard keys<br/>
                &#8226;Mouse - mouse support<br/>
                &#8226;2Axis - support for full 2axis range from -1.0 to 1.0
            </div>
        </div>
        <div>
            <font color='#C6CDA8'>L2 and R2</font>
        </div>
        <div>L2 and R2 are axis. Works similarly to buttons, but currently support only keys.</div>
        <div>
            <font color='#EBB16C'>Tilt</font>
        </div>
        <div>
            A silly function for those inclined to use it in racing games. ;)

                &#8226;<a href="help/tips/ingame/general-settings/tilt_2axis.html">2Axis</a> - support for full 2axis range from -1.0 to 1.0

        <div>
            <font color='#C6CDA8'>2axis support</font>
        </div>
        <div>
            Since version 38 was added supports for native 2axis joystick.<br/><br/>
            These requirements must be meet: <br/><br/>
            &#8226;In game profile must be enabled "Native 2axis joystick" emulation. If the expert settings are enabled then type this in joystick section : <br/><br/>
            [joystick]<br/>
            joysticktype=2axis<br/><br/>
            &#8226;In addition many games requires setup joystick in their setup.exe or other configuration options<br/>
            &#8226;Many games will start joystick calibration at startup or in configuration options. It's required for proper joystick ingame functionality<br/>
        </div>

            <font color='#C6CDA8'>Temporary block</font>

            External keyboards connected to Android device usually don't support all keys. Lack of keys like F1, F2 etc might be a critical issue for dos programs.
            Fortunately Magic Dosbox offers solution. It is possible bind keys 1-0 to F1-F10 and temporarily block/unblock mapper with reserved key.
        </div>
        <div>
            &#8226;Reserved key - temporarily activates/deactivates mapper<br/>
        </div>
        <div>
            While testing was found another issue. External keyboard messed with key presses. Key press means sequence : KEY DOWN and hold down key to next KEY UP. But
            external keyboard used during development didn't hold key down, instead was sent sequence KEY DOWN, UP, DOWN, UP...for a time while was key pressed.
            Because of this must be reserved key toggler. Maybe other keyboards will work better and reserved key can disable/enable mapper for a time when is reserved key down.
            But there must be at least 1 keyboard what really sends standard key sequences.
