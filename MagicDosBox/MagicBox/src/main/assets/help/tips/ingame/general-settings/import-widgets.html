        <div>
            Since version 49 Magic Dosbox supports import widgets from another game profile. This feature is available when active design mode.
        </div>
        <div>
            <b><font color='#C6CDA8'>Import process</font></b>
        </div>
        <div>
            During import process are fixed various options and references. Widgets with references to another widgets are drop these references in case when referenced widgets were not part of import process.
            If widget inserted in bag is selected, but bag itself is not selected then widget is placed directly on screen.
        </div>
        <div>
            <b><font color='#C6CDA8'>Bag widget</font></b>
        </div>
        <div>
            Bag widgets with inserted widgets are displayed in picker in order - bag, then children. Bag has slightly different color then it's children.
            Long touch on bag will select all it's children.
        </div>
        <div>
            On top of picker dialog were added two helpful functions - select all and invert selection.
