    <h4><font color='#EBB16C'>Adding On-screen Controls</font></h4>
    <div>
        Playing MS-DOS games on touchscreen-based devices can be a pain. Fortunately Magic DOSBox focuses on playing via touchscreen, without the need for external devices plugged into your device (which sort of defeats the purpose of "mobile" anyway).
        You can add various on-screen control widgets on the screen, resize them and place them whenever you need. To add on-screen controls you need to switch
        to design mode using the button in the top-left corner of the General Settings menu. Pressing the same button again will switch you back to play mode.

        General Settings will be shown after you press the 'back' button of your device on the main screen.
