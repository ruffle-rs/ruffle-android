        <h4><font color='#EBB16C'>Swipes</font></h4>
        <div>
            A swipe is simply a quick finger drag in a particular direction on a touch screen. Note -- it doesn't work the same as a finger swipe on your android phone or tablet. The Magic DOSBox swipe is a compromise between mouse
            emulation, key mapping, and touchscreen functionality.
        </div>
        <div>
            <b><font color='#C6CDA8'>A Magic DOSBox swipe must meet the following criteria</font></b>
        </div>
        <div>
            &#8226;Swipe must go from the chosen side of the screen to the opposite. For example, a swipe to UP goes from top of the screen to the bottom.<br/>
            &#8226;A Swipe must be quick (Time between touch DOWN and touch UP must be less than 200 milliseconds)<br/>
            &#8226;Swipe swing must be greater than 50 pixels<br/>
        </div>
        <div>
            It's possible to map various widgets on swipes. These widgets will be executed if the appropriate direction is started.
        </div>
        <div>
            <b><font color='#C6CDA8'>These widgets can be mapped</font></b>
        </div>
        <div>
            &#8226;Key<br/>
            &#8226;Target<br/>
            &#8226;Bag<br/>
            &#8226;Special<br/>
        </div>
        <div>
            To the right of the mapped widget is a settings button. All mappable widgets share common options.
        </div>
        <div>
            <b><font color='#C6CDA8'>Mouse Move Cursor Only.</font></b> The next mouse click after the swipe will be ignored. This is useful
            when you use the "Target" widget for scrolling the screen in a real-time strategy.
        </div>
        <div>
            <b><font color='#C6CDA8'>Mouse Move and Click.</font></b> Same as above, but does not ignore the next mouse click.
        </div>
