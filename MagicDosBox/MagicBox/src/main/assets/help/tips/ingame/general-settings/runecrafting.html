            <img src="rune96.png">Runecrafting brings possibility to use external fonts in the widgets. Supported font format is "ttf"
            (or alternatively TTF). Imported fonts can be applied in widget's text properties.

        </div>
        <div>
            The new font can be imported with '+' button. There is no limit on how many fonts can be imported. Every font must be loaded to memory
            and eats additional device's resources. Beware of fonts from files which are bigger then 200KBytes.

        <div>
            Fonts are imported per game profile and all changes are done after confirming. These changes don't depend on "Save layout" button.

            <font color='#C6CDA8'>How to change font(rune) name?</font>
        </div>
        <div>
            Press the rune text to change it's name. New rune with default text will take name from loaded file.

                New font can have bigger letters then the default one. This can cause that the text may became invisible
                in widget's text area. In this case just increase the area with buttons on floating toolbar.

                Magic dosbox loads fonts through Android. During test phase happened that Android was not able to process
                all tested fonts, instead was loaded the default one.
