    <h4><font color='#EBB16C'>Right Mouse Click Support</font></h4>
    <div>
        One of the most frequently asked questions is about how to emulate the right mouse button on a touchscreen. Magic DOSBox supports several options.
    </div>
    <b><font color='#C6CDA8'>Right Click via "Mouse Touch" 
Widget</font></b>
    <div>
        You can place this mouse widget anywhere on the screen. This widget is very flexible and allows you to change the mouse button permanently
        (all subsequent taps will be executed as right clicks),  or only when you touch this widget. Using this widget is fast and without delay.
    </div>
        <b><font color='#C6CDA8'>Right Click via Gestures</font></b>
    <div>
        Gestures can be configured in the "General Settings" menu using the "Gestures and Mouse" options. Gestures require detection time and thus using this mouse mouse method is
        more or less delayed - depending on the gesture type.
    </div>
    <div>
        <font color='#C6CDA8'><u>These gestures support right mouse click</u></font>
    </div>
    <div>
        &#8226;Double Tap<br/>
        &#8226;Two-point Gesture<br/>
        &#8226;Long-press<br/>
    </div>
