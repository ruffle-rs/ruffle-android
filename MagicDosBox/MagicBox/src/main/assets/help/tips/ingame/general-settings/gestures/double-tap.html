        <h4><font color='#EBB16C'>Double Tap</font></h4>
        <div>
            The default action in Magic DOSBox for a double tap is a right mouse button click. Tapping twice at the same place will trigger it (based on settings).
        </div>
        <div>
            Double tap is a delayed action. This means that all mouse clicks must be delayed, because Magic DOSBox checks if you tap once or twice.
            Double tap requires at least 210ms for detection, but the whole action takes around 300ms and is slow.

            There is a difference using double tap between absolute and relative mouse modes. Absolute tap is much more inaccurate than relative and
            requires 50pixels tolerance, whereas relative needs only 5. You may want to toggle between absolute and relative mouse modes when you need precision.
