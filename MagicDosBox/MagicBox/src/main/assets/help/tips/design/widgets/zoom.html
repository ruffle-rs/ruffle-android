        <h4><font color='#EBB16C'>Telescope Widget</font></h4>
        <div>
            Primary function of Telescope widget is magnifying game scene. But in version 53 was it's functionality greatly
            improved by adding Stream mode. Currently two modes are supported :
        </div>
        <div>
            &#8226;Default<br/>
            &#8226;Stream<br/>
        </div>
        <div>
            <b><font color='#C6CDA8'>Default</font></b>
        </div>
        <div>Default mode is standard way how to zoom in/out game scene. Default mode can be set to one of these flags "Until is button pressed" and "Permanent".
        First flag needs 3 fingers (for zooming game) or 2 fingers (for moving game) placed on the screen. First finger holds telescope widget and 2 another fingers controls game size.
        Or first finger hold telescope widget and second finger controls game scene position. Second flag does the same, but was designed for devices
        which supports only two fingers</div>
        <div>
            <b><font color='#C6CDA8'>Stream</font></b>
        </div>
        <div>
            This mode was added in version 53 and is very special type of control. Allows select part of screen and then streams this selection
            to telescope widget's background or foreground (depends on settings). NOTE : Streaming to background is MUCH efficient to GPU memory then streaming
            to foreground.
        </div>
        <div>
            Streamed screen support absolute mouse interaction (game must support absolute mouse). Relative mouse does not work. In options is possibe
            setup which mouse button should be used.
        </div>
        <div>
            In addition is possible to define another (combo) selection. Pressing this selection can trigger deadly strike/combo actions. This way
            we can create interative user interface. For example : We stream small part of screen which shows hero statistics containing portrait, left and right hand.
            Click on the hero portrait displays inventory. Click on left or right hand removes holding item. We can make selection
            only for hero portrait. Now if we click on portrait, we can trigger combo widget what hides current telescope widget and displays
            another telescope widget what streams hero's inventory. See our youtube channel for video guides.
