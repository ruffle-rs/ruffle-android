        <h4><font color='#EBB16C'>Floating Toolbar</font></h4>
        <div>
            The floating toolbar is used for manipulating single or multiple widgets. It's displayed if at least
            one widget is selected. The toolbar has two levels.
        </div>
        <div>
            <b><font color='#C6CDA8'>First Level</font></b>
        </div>
        <div>
            When the toolbar is present, the initial view you see is the first level. You'll notice arrows for moving the widget(s) on the screen, or for changing the widget(s) size. Whether you are moving or resizing a widget depends on the button located in the middle of the arrows, which toggles the functionality. If you have enabled multi-selection (which is toggled on the Second Level of the toolbar) you'll also see buttons for aligning multiple widgets to the right of the arrows.
        </div>
        <div>
            <b><font color='#C6CDA8'>Second Level</font></b>
        </div>
        <div>
            On the second level there are several other buttons which control toggling multi-selection, and for duplicating and deleting widgets. There are several additional alignment buttons as well. There is a built-in detailed hint for each button. If a bag is selected, you'll notice a special button appear in the right-top corner for opening this widget.
