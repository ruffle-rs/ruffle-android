        <div>
            The widget configuration windows has two important parts. The header settings and the widget's specific settings.

            <b><font color='#C6CDA8'>Header Settings</font></b>
        </div>
        <div>
            Header settings are split into two sections: the first section,  "Look and Feel" in which you can change the foreground image, background image, color,
            opacity and text. The second section, "General" contains flags for controlling widgets.

            <b><font color='#C6CDA8'>Flags</font></b>
        </div>
        <div>
            &#8226;<font color='#EBB16C'>Undetectable</font> - the widget is not recognized by your finger and is invisible. This is useful for mapping.<br/><br/>
            &#8226;<font color='#EBB16C'>Visible</font> - with visibility disabled, the widget is detectable, but is not shown. You can create an invisible
            Escape key for example.<br/><br/>
            &#8226;<font color='#EBB16C'>Activate on Tap Only</font> - If enabled, the widget can't be activated during a finger drag. Disabling this setting is useful
            for arcade games.<br/><br/>
            &#8226;<font color='#EBB16C'>Deactivate on Leave</font> - the widget is deactivated when your finger leaves its borders when your finger drags on the screen. Disabling this can be useful
            for the "Master of Puppets" widget.<br/><br/>
