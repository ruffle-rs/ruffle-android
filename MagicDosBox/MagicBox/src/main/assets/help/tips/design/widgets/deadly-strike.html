            The "Key", "Bag" and "Ghostly Presence" actions have two settings menus. In the first menu, push the middle of the row for picking a key or widget.
            After that, the second menu will appear -- showing additional (detailed) settings button on the right side.
        </div>
        <div>
            The "Black magic" has mouse reset action. Can be combined with keys. If the mouse reset is used after key
            and should be fired after the key then put small delay between key and mouse reset - around 80-90ms.
        </div>
        <div>
            Deadly strike and Key widget can be bound to startup. This means that actions will be fired soon after start automatically.

            <b><font color='#C6CDA8'>Tip: Added actions can be removed with a long-press on the action.</font></b>
