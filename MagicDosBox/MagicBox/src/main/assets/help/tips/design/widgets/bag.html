        <h4><font color='#EBB16C'>Bag</font></h4>
        <div>
            The Bag is a container for other widgets. It works like a closable toolbar and can be used like a spellbook if you are a wizard. Or a macro if you are not. The potential for this "macro-nomicon" are only limited by your imagination!
            Magic dosbox implements two types of Bag containers: Auto-aligned, and Custom.

        <div>
            &#8226;<font color='#EBB16C'>Auto-aligned</font> - widgets are "wrapped" -- they automatically fit where they can in the Bag.<br/>
            &#8226;<font color='#EBB16C'>Custom</font> - Allows you to specify the column and row count. Widgets are manually placed in the custom Bag grid.<br/>

        <div>
            Widgets can be inserted into a bag two ways. Selected widgets can be dragged and dropped directly on a "Bag" widget. But the better way is
            to open a Bag first and then place the widget on an exact position. In design mode the bag is opened via the "bag" icon on the second level of the floating menu.
            In "Custom" mode, you have full control of positioning, but positioning is available for "Auto-aligned" mode too (just keep in mind the wrapping function).
            Magic dosbox checks if a widget was dropped on the left or right side of an already added widget.

            A Maximum of 40 widgets can be inserted, but how much you actually see on the screen depends on your screen size. This is important because:
